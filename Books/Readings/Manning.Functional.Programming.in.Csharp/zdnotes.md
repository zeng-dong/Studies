# Part 1 Getting Started
Basic techniques and principles
1. what fp is and how c# supports programming in a functional style
2. how functions are represented in c#. Delves into higher-order functions, a fundamental technique of fp
3. what pure functions are, why purity has important implications for a function's testability, why purity is good to parallelization and other optimizations
