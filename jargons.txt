1. Reconstitute the Aggregate from old events
2. Interact with the model
3. Persist/dispatch new events

Event
	a representation of a historical fact;
	something that happpened in the past.

	so make sense to make it an immutable value object
		class PurchaseWasMade
		{
			private int Amount;
			public ctor(int amount){ Amount = amount}
			public int GetAmount(){}		
		}
	everything in the ctor contains the context that is associated with the intention that describes the class

Aggregate Root
	an interaction interface to your domain, limited by a consistency boundary
